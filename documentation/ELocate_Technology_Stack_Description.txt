                    ELOCATE - TECHNOLOGY STACK DESCRIPTION
                        E-waste Management Platform
================================================================================

• Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to design and structure 
  the user interface. React and Next.js frameworks provide dynamic, responsive 
  components for seamless user experience. Tailwind CSS enables rapid, utility-first 
  styling for modern aesthetics.

• Back-End Development: Java with Spring Boot framework is implemented for handling 
  server-side logic, RESTful API development, and robust business layer operations. 
  PostgreSQL manages relational data for users, facilities, and bookings, while 
  MongoDB handles unstructured data for AI model outputs and analytics.

• Deep Learning: Utilizes TensorFlow and PyTorch for object detection algorithms to 
  identify and classify e-waste devices through image recognition. Convolutional 
  Neural Networks (CNN) are employed for visual pattern detection in device categorization.

• AI & Text Detection: Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) for ML-powered chatbot 
  support and device information extraction. OpenCV is used for real-time QR code 
  scanning and device recognition through camera integration.

• Mapping & Location Services: MapBox API provides interactive mapping for e-waste 
  facility visualization and real-time location tracking. Google Maps integration 
  enables geolocation, route optimization, and distance calculation for pickup services.

• Authentication & Security: Auth0 handles secure user authentication with JWT token-based 
  authorization. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures proper separation of Citizen, 
  NGO, and Admin functionalities.

• Testing: Comprehensive testing suite includes unit tests for backend services, 
  integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for user workflows. 
  Automated testing validates system reliability and performance.

• DevOps: Docker ensures smooth containerization and deployment across environments. 
  Git and GitHub Actions provide version control and CI/CD pipelines. Vercel hosts 
  the frontend application, while Railway manages backend infrastructure deployment.

• Gamification & Analytics: Real-time impact dashboards visualize user contributions, 
  CO2 savings, and e-waste statistics. Points system, leaderboards, and digital 
  certificates drive user engagement through reward mechanisms.

• Data Processing: Python scripts handle batch processing for analytics, report 
  generation, and predictive modeling. Data pipelines aggregate facility performance 
  metrics and environmental impact calculations.
