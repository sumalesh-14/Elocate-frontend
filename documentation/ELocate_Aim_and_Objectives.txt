                AIM & OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
                        (Problem Statement)
================================================================================

Aim of the project
------------------

The project aims to revolutionize e-waste management by creating a comprehensive 
platform that connects citizens with certified e-waste disposal facilities. 
By integrating advanced technologies including AI/ML, blockchain verification, 
and real-time geolocation services, it provides users with an intelligent system 
to responsibly dispose of electronic waste, track their environmental impact, 
earn rewards, and contribute to reducing the global e-waste crisis while promoting 
environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance.


Objectives of the Project
--------------------------

• Smart Facility Locator: Utilize AI-powered geolocation and MapBox/Leaflet APIs 
  to identify nearest certified e-waste collection centers with real-time 
  availability, capacity information, and accepted device types.

• Seamless Booking & Pickup System: Enable users to schedule doorstep pickups, 
  track collection status in real-time, and receive instant confirmation with 
  QR code verification for secure transactions.

• AI-Powered Device Recognition: Implement machine learning models using TensorFlow 
  and computer vision to automatically identify electronic devices from photos, 
  provide instant value estimation, and generate recycling recommendations.

• Gamification & Rewards System: Develop an incentive mechanism where users earn 
  points for each recycling transaction, redeem for vouchers or cashback, and 
  compete on leaderboards to encourage consistent participation.

• Interactive Impact Dashboard: Visualize users' environmental contributions with 
  metrics such as CO2 saved, materials recovered, and carbon footprint reduction, 
  with social media sharing capabilities.

• ML-Powered Chatbot Assistant: Implement an intelligent conversational AI using 
  NLP and machine learning to provide 24/7 support, answer e-waste queries, offer 
  personalized recycling recommendations, and guide users through the disposal process.

• Educational Hub: Provide comprehensive resources including video tutorials, 
  recycling guides, environmental impact calculators, and sustainability courses 
  with certification to raise awareness.

• Corporate Dashboard: Enable businesses to manage bulk e-waste disposal, track 
  compliance with environmental regulations, access detailed analytics, and 
  generate automated CSR reports.

• Multi-Platform Accessibility: Develop responsive web application using Next.js 
  and mobile applications for iOS and Android with offline mode, push notifications, 
  and barcode scanning for device registration.

• Role-Based Access Control: Implement secure authentication using Auth0 with 
  distinct roles (Citizen, NGO/Facility, Administrator) each with appropriate 
  permissions and features.


================================================================================
Problem Statement
------------------

• E-waste Crisis: 53.6 million tons of e-waste generated globally in 2019, 
  projected to reach 74 million tons by 2030, with exponential growth rates.

• Poor Recycling Rates: Only 17.4% of e-waste is properly recycled, leaving 
  82.6% improperly disposed, causing severe soil, water, and air pollution.

• Toxic Materials: E-waste contains hazardous substances (lead, mercury, cadmium, 
  beryllium) causing serious health risks and long-term environmental damage.

• Consumer Awareness Gap: Most people lack knowledge about where and how to 
  dispose of electronic devices safely and responsibly.

• Fragmented Infrastructure: No centralized platform connecting citizens with 
  verified, certified recycling facilities in their local area.

• Compliance Challenges: Organizations struggle to track proper disposal, obtain 
  documentation for CSR requirements, and meet environmental regulations.

• Lack of Incentives: No motivation system exists to encourage people to 
  consistently recycle their e-waste instead of discarding it improperly.
