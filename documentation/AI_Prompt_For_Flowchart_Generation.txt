ALTERNATIVE PROMPT FOR MERMAID DIAGRAM:
---------------------------------------

Generate a Mermaid flowchart code for the ELocate application with three main workflows (Citizen, NGO/Facility, Admin) including authentication, facility location, AI device recognition, booking system, verification processes, and backend integrations. Use subgraphs for each user role, include decision points for approvals, and show connections between users and database systems.

================================================================================

TOOLS YOU CAN USE:
------------------

1. **ChatGPT/DALL-E**: Use the main prompt above
2. **Mermaid Live Editor** (mermaid.live): Use Mermaid syntax
3. **Lucidchart**: Paste description and ask AI to generate
4. **Draw.io/Diagrams.net**: Manual creation using description
5. **Figma**: Design custom flowchart
6. **Microsoft Visio**: Professional diagrams
7. **Canva**: Quick visual flowcharts
