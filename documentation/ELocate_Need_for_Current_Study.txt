                    NEED FOR THE CURRENT STUDY
================================================================================

➤  With the exponential growth of electronic waste (53.6 million tons in 2019, 
   projected to reach 74 million tons by 2030), there is an urgent need for 
   technology-driven solutions to address the e-waste crisis. Current disposal 
   methods are fragmented, with only 17.4% of e-waste being properly recycled. 
   Citizens lack awareness about certified disposal facilities, and there is no 
   centralized platform connecting users with verified recycling centers in 
   their area.

➤  This study addresses these critical limitations by developing a comprehensive 
   e-waste management platform that integrates smart facility location services, 
   real-time booking systems, and AI/ML technologies. By combining GPS-based 
   geolocation with MapBox/Leaflet APIs, users can instantly locate nearest 
   certified collection centers. The platform incorporates gamification and 
   rewards to encourage participation, while impact dashboards visualize 
   environmental contributions (CO2 savings, materials recovered) providing 
   data-driven motivation for sustainable behavior.

➤  The system creates a multi-stakeholder circular economy ecosystem connecting 
   citizens, NGOs, and businesses through role-based workflows. This addresses 
   the gap identified in literature regarding stakeholder integration and value 
   chain optimization. By implementing secure authentication, facility network 
   management, and corporate compliance tracking, the platform ensures proper 
   documentation for CSR requirements and regulatory compliance, making e-waste 
   disposal more accessible, transparent, and effective for users of all types.
